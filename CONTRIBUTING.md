# Contributing to lm15-python

This document covers the maintainer-facing machinery: the fixture/conformance
system, the doc-drift checker, the provider adapter development guide, and the
day-to-day commands.

## The contract pin (CONTRACT_PIN)

CI runs the language-neutral lm15-contract harness against this repo at the
exact contract commit recorded in `CONTRACT_PIN` (a full SHA of
`lm15-dev/lm15-contract` main). Discipline: when a change here requires a
contract change (new fixture, spec row, serde kind, protocol op), land the
contract commit first — with the evidence AUTHORITY.md demands — then bump
`CONTRACT_PIN` to that SHA in the same lm15-python commit as the code
change, so both repos stay green at every pinned pair of revisions. Never
bump the pin just to make CI green: the diff between the old and new pin is
part of your review.

## How the fixture/conformance system works

The conformance suite checks that lm15's canonical model stays aligned with real
provider APIs.

```text
logical lm15 case
  conformance/cross_sdk/test_cases.json
        │
        ▼
lm15-python provider adapter builds HTTP request
        │

        ├── check_request_fixtures.py compares request shape
        ├── validate_live.py can send the request to the real API
        ├── check_response_fixtures.py parses saved response bodies/SSE
        ├── check_error_fixtures.py normalizes provider error bodies
        ├── check_endpoint_fixtures.py checks files/batch/image/audio/live
        ├── check_serde_fixtures.py checks canonical JSON round trips
        └── check_doc_drift.py checks provider docs against features.yaml
```

Run everything:

```bash
python3 conformance/run_all.py --strict
```

Run one check:

```bash
python3 conformance/check_doc_drift.py --strict
python3 conformance/check_response_fixtures.py --strict
```

Run or preview one live provider fixture, if the relevant API key is set:

```bash
python3 conformance/provider_requests/validate_live.py --dry-run --task openai.basic_text
python3 conformance/provider_requests/validate_live.py --task openai.basic_text
```

Generated reports are written under `conformance/reports/` and are ignored by
git.

### Adding or completing a fixture

1. Add or update the logical case in
   `conformance/cross_sdk/test_cases.json`.
2. Add the expected provider HTTP request in
   `conformance/provider_requests/cases/<provider>/<feature>.json`.
3. Add the feature to `conformance/provider_requests/features.yaml` so doc drift
   can tell whether provider documentation is represented.
4. If response parsing should be checked, add an `expect_lm15` block to the
   provider case and save a real response body under
   `conformance/provider_requests/results/bodies/<provider>.<feature>/`.
5. If the provider has a special error shape, add an error case under
   `conformance/errors/cases/<provider>.json`.
6. Run:

   ```bash
   python3 conformance/run_all.py --strict
   pytest -q
   ```

Example `expect_lm15` block:

```json
{
  "expect_lm15": {
    "parts": {
      "text": {"min": 1},
      "citation": {"min": 1}
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop",
    "usage": {"required": true}
  }
}
```

### Doc-drift fixture check

`conformance/check_doc_drift.py` parses the scraped provider reference pages
in the sibling `lm15-contract/scrapes/<provider>/pages/` directory
(refreshed by each provider's `update.sh`; `LM15_API_REFERENCES` overrides
the location) and compares top-level request parameters with
`conformance/provider_requests/features.yaml`. There is no snapshot in this
repo: a second copy drifted once already.

Some always-on lm15 request fields do not need separate feature entries:

```python
IGNORE_PARAMS = {"model", "messages", "contents", "input"}
```

Provider docs often use camelCase/PascalCase while lm15 feature names use
snake_case, so the drift check normalizes names before deciding that a param is
unmapped.

If `check_doc_drift.py --strict` reports an unmapped param, either:

- add a real feature entry to `features.yaml`, or
- add the param to `IGNORE_PARAMS` only if it is a core field that should never
  have a separate fixture.

## Provider adapter development guide

Provider classes live in `lm15/providers/` and inherit `BaseProviderLM`.
A provider adapter is responsible for:

- `build_request(request, stream)` — map canonical `Request` to an HTTP request.
- `parse_response(request, response)` — map provider JSON to canonical
  `Response`.
- `parse_stream_events(...)` — map SSE chunks to `StreamEvent`s (the single
  stream-parse path per provider).
- `normalize_error(status, body)` — map provider errors to `lm15.errors`.
- Optional endpoint methods: `file_upload`, `batch_submit`,
  `image_generate`, `audio_generate`, `live`.

Keep provider-only options in `Config.extensions` rather than adding universal
fields unless the same concept is supported across providers.

## What makes a contribution acceptable

Every pull request is judged against these requirements; they are the
source of truth for both contributors and reviewers:

1. **Tests.** Behavior changes come with tests — unit tests in `tests/`,
   and fixture/conformance updates when the wire behavior changes (see
   the fixture workflow above). "It works locally" is not evidence.
2. **The contract comes first.** Changes to wire behavior land in
   `lm15-contract` before they land here, and `CONTRACT_PIN` moves in
   the same commit as the code (see the pin discipline above).
3. **Stdlib only.** No new runtime dependencies. See the dependency
   policy below for the (high) bar to change that.
4. **CI must be green.** The full pytest suite, the strict conformance
   suite, and the pinned contract harness all run on every push and
   pull request.
5. **Sign your work (DCO).** Every commit must carry a
   `Signed-off-by:` line asserting the [Developer Certificate of
   Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) — that you have the legal
   right to contribute the change. Enable the repo hook once per clone
   and every commit is signed off automatically:

   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```

   (Manual alternative: `git commit -s`.)
6. **No secrets.** Never commit API keys, tokens, or fixture data
   captured with real credentials. Secret scanning with push protection
   is enabled and will reject such pushes.
7. **Adapt, record, refuse — in that order (MAP-13).** When a setting
   cannot go to a wire as asked, ask what the caller MEANT and whether
   this provider can deliver it — never "does this wire have a field of
   this name". Same meaning, other spelling: translate. Cannot, and
   nothing depends on it: adapt (drop / clamp / substitute / client-side
   / satisfied / defaulted) and record it in `Response.adaptations`.
   Refuse only under MAP-13's four conditions, naming the one that
   applies. A new refusal in a pull request must cite its condition; a
   refusal that rests on a compat-preset value with no live receipt is
   rejected (`lm15-contract/docs/mapping-rules.md` MAP-13,
   `lm15-dev/THEORY.md` §3.9, §3.17).

## Building from source

The package is pure Python with no build-time dependencies beyond
`setuptools`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lm15-dev/lm15-python.git
cd lm15-python
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .              # editable install
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pyyaml   # test tooling
pytest -q                     # verify the checkout
```

To build distributable artifacts (sdist + wheel):

```bash
pip install build
python -m build
```

Optional extra: `pip install -e '.[live]'` pulls in `websockets` for
live/realtime sessions. Nothing else is required.

## Dependency policy

How lm15 selects, obtains, and tracks dependencies:

- **Selection: default no.** The runtime is Python stdlib only — this
  is a design guarantee (see the README footprint section), not an
  accident. A new runtime dependency requires a maintainer decision
  that the functionality is impossible or unreasonable to provide with
  the stdlib, and that the candidate is actively maintained, widely
  used, and itself light on transitive dependencies. The only current
  example is the optional `websockets` extra for live sessions — it is
  opt-in and the core never imports it.
- **Obtainment.** Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml` and
  installed from PyPI through standard tooling (pip/uv); CI installs
  them the same way. Nothing is vendored, and no artifacts are
  fetched outside the package manager.
- **Tracking.** `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth for
  runtime requirements. Development and CI tooling (pytest, mkdocs)
  is listed in the workflows that use it. GitHub dependency graph and
  secret scanning watch the repository.

## Cross-language conformance: lm15-contract

The sibling `lm15-contract` repository is where cross-language conformance
lives — it is the authority, and this package is one implementation of it.
Start with its `AUTHORITY.md` (what is normative and what wins on conflict),
`spec/` (the canonical rules: serde, mapping, errors), and `harness/` (the
runner that executes the shared corpus of cases, goldens, bodies, and error
fixtures against each language implementation). Behavior changes here must be
reflected there first, then re-verified through the harness.

## Useful commands

```bash
# First check out lm15-contract as a sibling at CONTRACT_PIN.
# Tests read its cloud signing/token vectors during collection.

# Unit and conformance tests through pytest
pytest -q

# Full offline conformance suite
python3 conformance/run_all.py --strict

# Request fixture comparison only
python3 conformance/check_request_fixtures.py --strict

# Response/SSE fixture parser check only
python3 conformance/check_response_fixtures.py --strict

# Canonical JSON round trips only
python3 conformance/check_serde_fixtures.py --strict

# Provider-doc coverage only
python3 conformance/check_doc_drift.py --strict
```
